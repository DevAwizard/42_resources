# 42 Resources Repository

Welcome to the **42 Resources** repository! This is the repository I wish I could have found when I first started learning to code, especially with C as my first programming language at 42 School.

### Purpose

This repository is designed to be a comprehensive collection of resources, tools, and guides to help you navigate the challenges of learning C and other essential programming concepts as part of the 42 curriculum. Whether you’re a beginner or someone looking to deepen your understanding, you’ll find materials here that will support your learning journey.
