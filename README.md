# ðŸŽ“ 42 Resources Repository

Welcome to the **42 Resources** repository! This is the collection of resources I wish I had when I first started learning to code, especially with **C** as my first programming language at **42 School**.



### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

When I first started at 42 School, I was a complete beginner and often struggled to find the right resources to help me understand **C** and the foundational programming concepts. This repository is a collection of all the resources I wish I could have found when I started. Itâ€™s designed to guide you through the same journey, offering the support and insights I gained along the way.



### ðŸš€ Getting Started

#### ðŸ’» Setting Up Your Workspace Environment

**Why is it Important to Create a GitHub Account?**

Creating a GitHub account is a crucial step in your journey as a programmer, particularly at **42 School**. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Version Control**: GitHub is the most widely used platform for version control, essential for managing your code, tracking changes, and collaborating with others. Learning how to use GitHub will make it easier to work on projects, both individually and in teams.

- **Collaboration**: Many projects at 42 involve collaboration with other students. GitHub allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, making it easier to merge contributions, review code, and resolve conflicts.

- **Portfolio Building**: Your GitHub profile becomes a public portfolio showcasing your work. Future employers or collaborators can see the projects youâ€™ve worked on, your coding style, and your problem-solving skills.

- **Access to Resources**: By using GitHub, you can easily access and contribute to open-source projects, a valuable learning experience. It also opens up opportunities to collaborate with a global community of developers.

- **Student Benefits**: Since youâ€™re part of 42 School, you can access the **GitHub Student Developer Pack**, which includes a free GitHub Pro account and various other tools and resources to help you in your learning journey.

##### ðŸŽ’ How to Get Your GitHub Pro Account
