### ✅ Final Checklist Before Submitting Your 42 Project

Before submitting your project at 42, it's crucial to ensure all aspects meet the required standards. Here's a checklist:

1. **Norminette Compliance**  
   Run `norminette` on all source and header files to ensure style compliance.

2. **No Hidden Files**  
   Remove hidden files like `.DS_Store`, `a.out`, or `.vscode`.

3. **Memory Leaks**  
   Use `valgrind` to check for memory leaks.

4. **No Global Variables**  
   Verify no global variables are used unless explicitly allowed.

5. **Expected Output**  
   Test your program to ensure it outputs correctly for all required and edge cases.

6. **Makefile**  
   Ensure your Makefile has all necessary rules (`all`, `clean`, `fclean`, `re`) and compiles without errors.

7. **Header Files**  
   Check your header file for correct function prototypes, macros, and includes.
